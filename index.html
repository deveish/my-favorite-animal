            <p> My favorite animal is the snake </p>
            <p> Snakes are incredible, legless reptiles found across the globe.</p>
             <p>They use their muscles to slither, and some can even climb trees or swim.</p>
             <p> Fun fact: a snakeâ€™s tongue is used to "taste" the air and detect scents!</p>
             <p> Another interesting fact is that some snakes, like the king cobra, can grow over 18 feet long.</p> <p>Despite their fearsome reputation, most snakes are harmless and help control pests.</p>
